# Logical Neural Networks
LNNs are a novel `Neuro = Symbolic` framework designed to seamlessly provide key
properties of both neural nets (learning) and symbolic logic (knowledge and reasoning).

- Every neuron has a meaning as a component of a formula in a weighted
  real-valued logic, yielding a highly interpretable disentangled representation.
- Inference is omnidirectional rather than focused on predefined target
  variables, and corresponds to logical reasoning, including classical
  first-order logic theorem proving as a special case.
- The model is end-to-end differentiable, and learning minimizes a novel loss
  function capturing logical contradiction, yielding resilience to inconsistent
  knowledge.
- It also enables the open-world assumption by maintaining bounds on truth values
  which can have probabilistic semantics, yielding resilience to incomplete
  knowledge.

## Quickstart
To install the LNN:
1. Install [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) and gmp (libgmp3-dev)

      <div>
      If you experience a "graphviz/cgraph.h" file not found error, try the following:
      
      ```bash
      # Using Conda
      conda install -c anaconda graphviz
      ```
      Alternatively you can install the OS specific versions as follows:
      ```bash
      # Ubuntu and Debian
      sudo apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev
      ```
      ```bash
      # MacOS
      brew install graphviz
      ```
      </div></details>

      If you experience a "gmp.h" file not found error, try the following:
       ``` bash
      # Windows Powershell / Anaconda 
      conda install --channel conda-forge pygraphviz
      ```

      ```bash
      # MacOS
      brew install gmp
      env "CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib" pip install pycddlib
      ```
      ```bash
      #Ubuntu and Debian
      sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config
      sudo -H apt-get install libgmp-dev python3-dev
      ```
      </div></details>

2. Make sure that the python version you use in line with our [setup](https://github.com/IBM/LNN/blob/master/setup.py) file, using a fresh environment is always a good idea:
    ```commandline
    conda create -n lnn python=3.9 -y
    conda activate lnn
    ```
3. Install the LNN as a library:
    ```commandline
    pip install git+https://github.com/IBM/LNN.git
    ```
