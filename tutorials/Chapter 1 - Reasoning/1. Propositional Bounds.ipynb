    "## Bounds On Beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending Classical Truths\n",
    "\n",
    "In [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics#Logic), logical systems reason using a finite set of truth values, namely <strong style=color:#0e6027>TRUE</strong> or <strong style=color:#ba4e00>FALSE</strong>. LNNs extend the expressiveness of the logic by allowing truth values to operate outside of the classical `{0, 1}` range as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;i. &emsp;truths can be any intermediate truth value between `[0, 1]`, </br>\n",
    "&emsp;ii.&emsp;truths can be bounded by a range of real-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two extensions allow for handling (_i._) greater uncertainty and (_ii._) greater ambiguity of truth values. Uncertainty pertains to a truth value that is neither _True_ nor _False_, but could instead be any indefinite value between $[0, 1]$. It is achieved by incorporating the theory of [real-valued logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic) into operator calculations, which will be expanded on in later notebooks. Ambiguity pertains to doubt in the semantics under the current context, thereby catering to more than one interpretation. This extends the representation of intermediate values to operate over a range, i.e., by keeping track of lower and upper bounds of real-values, represented as `[L, U]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LNN we refer to the representation of truth values as bounds on beliefs, or bounds for short. Due to their flexibility, the semantics of bounds cannot be interpreted as probabilities, but should instead be perceived as _beliefs_. That is, the extent to which a contextual application of the knowledge believes a particular symbol to be [truthful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth).\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously in the [Propositional Logic](./0.%20Propositional%20Logic.ipynb) notebook, we learned how to define propositions and their corresponding truths using `Facts`. In this notebook, we will expand on those ideas and demonstrate how to perform logical inference with bounds. \n",

    "\n",
    "Bounds are a pairwise representation of a truth range defined as a tuple of lower and upper real-values.

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a one-to-one mapping between classical facts and bounds, but a one-to-many mapping from non-classical facts to bounds. This relationship is expanded on in greater depth in [section F.2 of the LNN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13155.pdf). We demonstrate an example of a non-classical state below:"

This 5% uncertainty in the belief still caters for the semantics of absolute certainty, i.e., there may be other rules or facts present in the system that could cause our belief in the implication to collapse on the upper bound and become perfectly true, $[1.0, 1.0]$.\n",
