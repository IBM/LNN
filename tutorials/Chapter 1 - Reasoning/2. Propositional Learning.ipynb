    "In the previous notebooks, we've demonstrated how logic can be used to reason about data using knowledge. We've also seen how LNNs extend truth value semantics to include uncertainties and ambiguities about beliefs. However, one of the key advantages of neural networks is their ability to learn from the data and update parameters to achieve some objective. In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how learnable parameters can be included into LNNs and allow for logical consistency to be enforced.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [Propositional Logic Notebook](./0.%20Propositional%20Logic.ipynb) demonstrates how LNNs represent knowledge using as graphical structure to perform reasoning. These structures encode knowledge in a manner that is consistent with existing theorem provers but extend them by allowing bounds to encode truth value semantics. One of the advantages of using this representation is that logical inconsistencies can be identified once reasoning has taken place.\n",

    "A [logical inconsistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency) is a belief that a node should both be _True_ and _False_ simultaneously, introducing a new state called a <strong style=color:#d02670>CONTRADICTION</strong>. In LNNs it occurs when an inference computation updates the correct truths to be outside a viable range. From the bounds representation, this occurs when the lower bound crosses over the upper bound and introduces an infeasible inequality for the correct truth value, $T$:\n",

    "### Parameterising The Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow for parameter learning, LNNs extend the operators to a weighted real-value logic that can be updated using gradient descent and backpropogation techniques. This is achieved by parameterising the edges of the graph such that each operand has a weighted influence on the truth of the operator, in line with current neural networks.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each weighted [real-value logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic) has a different definition of a logical operation (even for the same symbol), but we can implement them all by modifying the activation function. In LNNs we therefore use a graph representation whereby some of the nodes behave as neurons, i.e. for weighted logical connectives such as `And`, `Or`, `Implies`.\n",
